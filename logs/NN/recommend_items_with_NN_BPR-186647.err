torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 4.70 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 22.03 GiB of which 3.59 GiB is free. Process 4015820 has 17.85 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 584.00 MiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 330.70 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 19.30 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
