torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 4.69 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 22.03 GiB of which 631.94 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.89 GiB memory in use. Process 2554147 has 19.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 1.64 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 21.57 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
